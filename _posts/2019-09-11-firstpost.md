# First post
Having tried and failed with a [Get Simple CMS](http://get-simple.info/) blog back in 2013, this blog uses [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) as a Github Pages only solution, with the aim of being able to maintain the site by using a browser only. 

[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is used locally for note-taking, with final versions copied over to Github as posts.
